1. Create a new environment 
		conda create -n car-detection-main python==3.6.9

2. install requirements

3. download the Pretrained 'faster_rcnn_inception' model from: 
		https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf1_detection_zoo.md

4. unzip the files from the model folder to the folder 'frozen_graph_faster_rcnn_inception'

5. RUN --> 
	python application.py

	* if you want to test using images: crate a test_images folder and place images inside it and call the test_on_image function with coorect image name.

	* if you want to test with video : crate data folder and place video inside it and call the run_video function with coorect video name.
